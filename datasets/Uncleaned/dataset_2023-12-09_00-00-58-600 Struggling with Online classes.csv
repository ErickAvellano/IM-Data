Online classes are a completely new way of learning we were all just thrown into; be easier on yourself! It takes time and practice to make a routine and get the hang of it, which I know is super hard, but it is truly the only way through. Here is my advice:

* Try to build a weekly routine that surrounds your schedule / due dates. Example, if you have homework due on Friday for a class every week, make a routine to do the homework Thursday afternoon or Friday morning every week. Then, do that for the rest of your assignments. It will build a routine and make it a little easier to do. 
* Go to the non-mandatory lectures, discussions, and office hours if you aren't understanding material; but if you are make sure to give yourself a break!! Taking brain-breaks from the computer is super important, I like to study in the morning, take a break in the afternoon for a walk / food, and then finish up in the evening for a couple hours. 
* When you listen to lectures, make sure you understand what is being said and try to be in an atmosphere where you can focus. If you don't understand, go back and listen again, google it, try youtube (especially for math or science)! 
* Make the little assignments count! If you are getting 95% or higher on all the little assignments, that will leave more lee-way for exams. 
* Get organized! Have your big assignments (Exam / Paper / Final Projects) on a big calendar to plan other life events around. On Sundays, list all your assignments due that week and make a schedule for when you WILL do those assignments (refer to bullet-point 1).
