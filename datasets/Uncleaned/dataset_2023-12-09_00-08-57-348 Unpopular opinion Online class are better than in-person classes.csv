I have a prof basically all what he does is prerecord lectures, split the grade weight into 4 assignments and yell at students during his 2 hours of availabilities. Only god knows what he does during this semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in my case i don&amp;#39;t really mind if we keep online lectures but at least reopen the buildings, i wanna take my usual seat at 7th floor HB and look at the sunset during hours&lt;/p&gt;

1) Yes x2 helps, but I mean even before covid I was not relying on my profs to learn something, I would watch that indian dude on youtube with his shitty mic and put the video on x2 so this point is not a revolution.  
2) You could do that before (Google being your 24/7 or stackoverflow for the cs/soen people)  
3) You do save transport time to get to the office since it's remote but doesn't give more opportunies to balance between internship and study

Pros:
- recorded lectures -&gt; ability to relisten at your pace
- I take digital notes so it’s convenient for me to just screenshot the lecture screen and ctrl V to my notes
- no commute - saves time and money
- I can eat a full course meal while listening to the lecture
- if I feel tired, I can just quit the lecture, go take a nap and watch the recording when my mind is back at 100% -&gt; better information retaining

Cons:
- eclass = e-exams, I have a love hate relationship with them. People cheat so profs curve the grade down to hell and then the people who didnt cheat suffer. Some profs make the exams insanely hard to avoid cheating. And don’t get me started on proctored exams
- certain classes require students to be in person practice - labs, etc. especially in engineering. We need to work with hardware. 
- human interactions - i miss seeing friends. Uni is the time to make friends and make connections for our future career as well. I have barely made any new friends since covid started.

In brief, I would be perfectly happy if schools are a mix of: online lectures + in person labs + in person tutorials + in person exams","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the pros and cons of e-classes in my case (I’m an engineering student):&lt;/p&gt;
