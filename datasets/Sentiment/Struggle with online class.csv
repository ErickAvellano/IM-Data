"&gt;Calc 3 isnt a requirement for this class but he keeps being up calc 3 concepts or things from linear algebra

Pretty strange that Calc III isn't a prerequisite for DE. At my university, prerequisites for DE are Calculus III and Linear Analysis I, and that's pretty typical from what I hear. I can't imagine trying to understand transforms and such without having some understanding of linear algebra and vector calculus first, it just doesn't make sense without that basis. 

That said, if you can get access  to Calculus: Early Transcendentals auth:James Stewart, that is an excellent resource and I know there are pdfs floating around various google drives all the time. Kahn Academy has excellent videos on linear algebra, like seriously, you can teach yourself LA with nothing but a textbook and Kahn Academy. If you just need to understand vector and matrix operations, even youtube will do fine, just search for the particular operation you need to learn",0.22179487179487176,Positive

On a side note this is interesting, where do you live?  In my state most schools have Calc 3 &amp; DE as 200 level courses, Calc 3 is 100 level at some schools.  Almost every 300 level math or engineering course I've seen has Calc 3, DE, Linear, or some co-requisite physics/engineering course of theirs as a pre-req.",0.37878787878787873,Positive
"Calc 3 not being a requirement doesn’t mean Diff Eq doesn’t use anything from it both are calculus subjects. The calc 3 in diff eq wasn’t bad if I remember right. It was literally just “this but with z”. 

Diff Eq in undergrad is largely cookbook math, thats what separates it from calcs 1-3. You may notice your professor skips derivations a lot. This is because they are probably way more advanced than anything you’ve seen and to teach you them would be a waste. The best way to pass Diff Eq is to shoot for memorization over understanding. At the end of the day, you are either setting up or solving a differential equation. The entire class is techniques to do this for a specific class of Diff Eq’s that have been rigorously solved by mathematicians. The class is about memorizing techniques that get you general/specific solutions that come in near identical forms most of the time, and to memorize those steps doesn’t usually require a complete understanding of them.

Most people’s advice in engineering and calc is “do problems until you get it”. For diff eq its more-so “do problems until you can do them in your sleep and then do more”. It sucks but there aren’t many other ways to get through this class that I know of.

I for one hated diff eq for this reason, and if your moving on to PDE’s, its more or less the same cookbook type math. The sources everyone else mentioned are great, especially professor leonard. Good luck man, online classes blow monkey dicks.",0.13317901234567905,Positive
"This sounds a lot like my experience although I liked and did a lot better in Diff Eqs than my calculus and linear algebra classes. I found Diff Eqs is just applying patterns to problems. Solving each problem was just doing the same step by step process to it that you’ve done with all the other problems. 

Don’t get me wrong, it can get tricky. I got A’s on all my midterms but bombed the final and ended up with a B in the class. I guess my professor saved all the really hard problems for the final.",0.022916666666666675,Positive

"I struggled with DE a lot... I ended up taking it four times (dropped it twice, got a D then finally passed with a B) Granted I did so poorly because I didn't take the necessary time to learn the material on my first couple attempts. So make sure you do that. What helped me understand the course was thinking of myself as a  program and having to apply the necessary operations to solve the given ODE. I am attaching a link to a professor at another university DE notes. I recommend at least peaking at them. Don't lose faith in yourself, I know things can be rough and feel completely lost. A mentality I found to be helpful is a challenge is an opportunity to grow as an individual
