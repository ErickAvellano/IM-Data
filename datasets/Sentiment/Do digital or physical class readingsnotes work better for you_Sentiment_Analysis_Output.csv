I think I retain information better when I read from a physical copy and take notes in a notebooks.  It forces me to slow down and it minimizes distractions.  If I’m feeling lazy or if I’m in a rush I’ll read off of my computer.  I go through one notebook a quarter and that’s when I take 4 classes so I don’t think that’s too bad for the environment.,-0.1509259259259259,Negative
"That's really interesting, especially the insight about how a physical copy makes you slow down.  Would you be willing to talk to me a little more for my story?  If you're willing we can work out details by PM.",0.09521604938271605,Positive
Sure.,0.5,Positive
"For me  when I take notes on my computer I tend to write more in more detail because I can type faster than I write. I also find that I refer back to notes more often if they are on my computer versus in a notebook.  The only exception I have to this is math, I think it is way easier to understand on paper, and the only thing that has come close to this is one note but I would still prefer paper.

For class readings/textbooks it is easier for me to use a digital copy because it is the same place I keep my notes, but I think I skim through it more and I learn more with a physical copy.

I think professors printing out papers everyday is definitely an issue, I have had some professors who had out 3+ pages every day in all their classes. Taking notes on paper is harder to get people to switch and I find when I do use physical notes I don't go through a lot of paper.",0.14666666666666664,Positive
"I'm pretty sure that your insights about readings/textbooks line up with what the science says, nice to hear their conclusions are true for some people.  Your observation about professors is also interesting, personally I process the information on physical handouts better but I agree that some of them go overboard.

Would you be willing to talk to me a little more for my story? It'd just be a ten-minute conversation.  If you're willing we can work out details by PM.",0.25096153846153846,Positive
Physically. I find typing not as intimate so im less aware of what im putting down.,0.025555555555555554,Positive
"I find that professors tend to have less of a grasp on how fast they may be lecturing even if you tell them to slow down, so since I type a lot faster than I write, I generally find myself taking digital notes. I would say I prefer writing since I retain the information a bit better, but it's become almost impossible with online classes since I write so slow.",-0.09320987654320988,Negative
"That makes a lot of sense :) The theoretical science doesn't matter so much when practicality comes into the picture, does it?",0.2333333333333333,Positive
"Absolutely. I wish that I had the time to write the notes, and I do try to rewrite important things in my notebook after the fact, but it's getting exceedingly impossible with these online classes.",-0.02222222222222218,Negative
"I quite enjoy physical notes and physical textbooks, but I just keep a notebook and will never print anything out due to not having a printer and wanting to avoid using the computer labs with COVID.

I have been known to go back and digitize some notes for important classes though.",0.1125,Positive
"I prefer online classes. I focus better in my apartment. I take all of my notes by hand during classes and readings. This also helps keep me focused. I don't worry about the sustainability of this at all. I don't go through massive amounts of paper. Besides, staying in my apartment vs driving to classes is already drastically better for the environment.

Edit to add: I forgot to mention books. Though I handwrite notes, I prefer digital books. I love being able to hit CTRL + F and find exactly the paragraph or question. I can mark them up without feeling like I need to worry about reselling.",0.32142857142857145,Positive
"Agreed, CTRL+F is a godsend.  

Would you be willing to talk to me a little more for my story? I'd love to be able to include someone who uses a more hybrid system.  If you're willing we can work out details by PM.",0.33035714285714285,Positive
Absolutely! PM me,0.25,Positive
"I’ve been able to tweak my setup to get it to work best for me.

I do all of my Zoom classes on my desktop computer, and I use my iPad to take notes. For homework, readings, etc i do that on my laptop somewhere other than my desk, the couch, outside, wherever. Breaking up the locations really help me to focus more on classes and relax a bit more during homework",0.3678571428571429,Positive
"Switching locations around is something I do too, it's so nice to have a change of scenery.  Like walking from class to class or working in the library during in-person classes.

Glad you've got a system that works for you :)",0.5333333333333333,Positive
I've always taken physical notes and used physical books. Digital notes don't work for me and I never wanted to try a digital book. To be fair I'm a science student and working through math problems or a chemistry reaction  seems more practical on paper as well.,0.19999999999999998,Positive
I got a rocketbook notebook to take physical notes but keep them digitally. It cuts down on paper for the environment and the mess. I love it!,0.05888888888888889,Positive
How exactly does a rocketbook notebook work?  I've seen people on the internet suggest them but I've never really paid attention.  Can you reuse it or something?,0.075,Positive
"Yeah, its essentially just erasable paper and pens, but it also has an app that you can use to take a really good quality scan that files in directly in any of the major cloud sharing areas (onedrive, Google drive, dropbox, etc) and it can use machine learning translate handwriting to text if you don't have terrible handwriting like I do. 
The only dislike I have it that it gets a bit smeared if you are a lefty, but that always happens, so I compensate by holding my hand in weird uncomfortable positions :)",-0.07083333333333336,Negative

I am definitely going to have to look into that. Can you search the notes after they're uploaded?,0.0,Neutral
"I only took one quarter of online classes at WWU before I finished but I also did a year of online classes in high school.

I have struggles with handwriting, so I've always handwritten on a tablet (Surface Pro) that has a smoothing program to steady my writing. I used OneNote to keep everything organized.

I've always done my readings digitally, so I can enlarge font and use search functions. It just makes my life much easier.

From a sustainability standpoint, I'm able to delete and get rid of the data eventually. Plus, I can use energy efficient options. While those paper notes are going to have to go through a lengthier recycling process.",0.1711111111111111,Positive
I have an iPad and write notes on that! So a bit of both?,0.0,Neutral
Individual choices like taking notes on paper have almost zero effect on the environment,0.0,Neutral
