"Personally I prefer In person, I like the connivence of online classes but my active participation takes a hit when online",-0.06666666666666667,Negative
"I prefer in lesson classes because I learn better inside the classroom, and it makes me more disciplined in my studies to go to class. Online I would be o distracted, and it would be harder for me to learn than inside the classroom.",0.3,Positive
"I prefer classes in person. I find it a drag and a half to force myself to watch the - in one case - 3 hour long crappy recording of the lecture. In a  person class, I could interact with fellow students and directly ask the professor questions instead of having to wait for them to respond to an email or try to hunt them down during their office hours.  If it is a difficult class or a class where there is a lot of problem solving, I find a lot more straight forward and the professors to be more accessible when I take the class in person.",0.07027777777777777,Positive
"Omg I didnâ€™t even realize that part of online classes, thank youðŸ˜­",0.0,Neutral
"I think this really depends on how you learn best and what environment you like personally. For me, Iâ€™m quite an introvert and have social anxiety so I prefer online classes. Itâ€™s also easier for me to feel organized and less stressed in online classes. For some people itâ€™s the opposite. Really just comes down to what you feel would be best for you. 

I will also note that last fall quarter I had to go to campus twice a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, and on one of those days Iâ€™d have classes for 4 hours straight. That was really exhausting. This past spring I only went to campus one day a week for 2 hours and it wasnâ€™t as bad.",0.0640740740740741,Positive
"Same for me. Social anxiety made it nearly impossible to learn anything when I took classes in person. It also didn't help my social anxiety at all. I learn much better online when I can relax and do my work from the bookstore, Panera, my apartment, etc.",-0.019999999999999997,Negative

"I commute about an hour to campus. I still prefer in person whenever possible.

Don't get me wrong, gas is a huge expense, but I cannot and will not focus online. I need to sit in the front of the class, with the professor staring at me, and calling me out everytime I mumble an answer to a question. This aids both my confidence and ADHD. This is my personal preference.",-0.02500000000000001,Negative
"I prefer online courses. None of mine require to watch online lectures or do homework at a certain time (asynchronous) meaning I just read, do homework, and a few quizzes. (Business Administration major)",0.025595238095238088,Positive
I know this is an old thread but Iâ€™m wondering of you do all of your classes online cause thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m thinking of doing?,0.1,Positive
Yes! I completed an associates without ever stepping foot on campus. Currently a little over halfway done with a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Business Administration as a fully remote student. Feel free to PM me any questions!,0.07083333333333335,Positive
"An important consideration for online classes is whether they're synchronous or asynchronous. Synch is basically the same as face to face in terms of class structure, but done through Zoom. This is usually a pretty good substitute for F2F, and even has some advantages of the prof knows what they're doing. Asynchronous is with pre -recorded lectures, staggered assignments, etc. and is pretty much the worst of all possible mediums in terms of engagement",0.1,Positive
"Definitely, as someone who works nights and sleeps during the day synchronous online classes are worthless. If the teacher has great videos, asynchronous is the way to go, because it is like having an almost perfect version of a lecture, but some teachers are terrible at it.",0.0,Neutral
"I'm a hybrid student &amp; I strongly prefer in person, I need the social interaction. It's easier to get help with in person too. The best thing about online courses is that mine are asynchronous, which allows me to work more hours.",0.4916666666666667,Positive
"It depends, some online classes are garbage and sometimes in-person classes are a waste of time because they could easily be done online. For me the hard sciences and labs are better in person and I feel like most of the humanities are better online. Especially, if the teacher has great videos. I have ADHD and get distracted easily in class, and I despise group learning. I can focus so much better in my office at home with comfortable clothes on, lighting, meditation tones playing, temperature to my liking. I can take notes at my own pace and can rewind the video if I need to hear something again and again and again.",0.34791666666666665,Positive
"Depending on the situation and the person, I switch from in-person to completely online. I did that because I hate my university, and I am planning on working for the next 2 years to get money for my master's degree.",-0.23333333333333336,Negative
"Lucky u got an online version. At my university education system, it is usually only reserved for Master's students",0.16666666666666666,Positive
"IMO the best route, if possible, is taking mostly on-campus classes but taking one or two easy/non-major online classes to make it to where youâ€™re not in classes all day everyday and getting burnt out. But being fully online gets boring and draining after one or two semesters.",0.06000000000000001,Positive
"I would 100% suggest in-person classes. Although they might be a pain, you'll actually learn more. With online, you can basically do whatever, but if you have in-person classes, you'll have the chance to meet your classmates, connect more with your professor, and overall I think have a better experience. 

As someone who took online classes due to covid--although I passed--i didn't feel like I was learning anything. Which is proven by the fact that everything I learned, I already forgot LMAO",0.28214285714285714,Positive
"In-person learning is optimal in most situations. Distance learning done correctly will suffice, especially if direct socialization isnâ€™t necessary for your chosen field. As long as that setting can hold your attention, you get out of it what you put in. Also, going through life avoiding human interaction is unhealthy. The real world is a difficult place, some things you canâ€™t understand just by watching/reading about it. Good luck!",0.09166666666666666,Positive

Itâ€™s really all down to personal preference. In my experience Iâ€™ve been doing online courses for roughly 3 years now and the one thing that happened with the vast majority of my courses was I lost my drive and motivation nearer the end. For example I start my spring semester on Feb 15th and by early May Iâ€™m half assing a lot of my assignments but still finishing with a good grade nonetheless. Iâ€™ve done exactly 2 courses in person and finished with an A in both and actually met my first girlfriend in one of them lol. All in all do what you prefer!,0.17314814814814813,Positive
