"I'm not a student anymore but I'd like to share my thoughts on this.

The transition of traditional to online classes isn't easy. Many teachers, if not all, need to learn how to use plenty of software just to accommodate students and parents in the middle of the pandemic. From textbooks and chalkboards to screen-sharing and Zoom meetings. This is new terrain and people are adjusting and you should be flexible. The entire system is adapting to this new culture because it hasn't been done before but please don't put the entire burden on educators as DepEd and CHED should be pro-active on this part, as well. I just think you have your expectations too high on so many levels.",0.1866060606060606,Positive
"I completely agree with you, however i want to take action and inform them that implementing the same amount of information to online classes is not the best idea, its been only the first week and there was so much pressure trying to keep up and have a good grade. I feel like its absolutely inhumane and unfair to students who are already struggling with the current situations",0.08636363636363634,Positive
"Though i do hope they notice this, i usually don‚Äôt like cheating like to actually learn the topic, however due to the pressure, i have to copy other people‚Äôs work just to meet the expected quota.",-0.12,Negative
"I think it's better to raise your concern in a much better platform like Facebook or Twitter since not many people in authority are on Reddit. Plus if you let your educator know your hassle as a student, he or she will make it better for sure. Just be patient with them as they need to improve, too. And if you copy other people's work just to meet expectations, I think that falls on both on you and the teacher.",0.2708333333333333,Positive
"Let's face it, if you were in New York, you'll be paying a ton of money for the same thing you're doing in Philippines - which is teaching yourself",0.06818181818181818,Positive
"Its true, however its not as simple learning something. They have to factor in that people are struggling because of the corona. As well as not everything will sail as smooth as they expect it to be",0.25,Positive
"You should've stayed in New York, James.",0.13636363636363635,Positive

"For starters, you're in a country where a facist leader reigns supreme and you can get tagged as a terrorist if you're an activist. If you find cops disgusting in US, wait til you find out what the cops here in ph are made out of. The government doesn't listen to its people and doesn't seem to acknowledge them. 

We've been asking for academic freeze cause online classes are anti-poor and isn't that effective as to not all of the programs in college are teachable online.  We have labs as well and teaching online isn't going to cut it. There are a lot of factors into why it isnt safe here as of the moment. 

Also, it's not really healthy for students. If you're not ready and it's really taking a toll on yor mental health, you can rest or if you really want to continue, some universities still have guidance councilors online where in you can approach them and talk about your problems. Please take care of your mental health bro!!",-0.010624999999999999,Negative

i cant imagine what online school is like in the Philippines (and other countries) especially those who don‚Äôt have access to internet/devices. i really hope this pandemic ends,0.025000000000000005,Positive
Since my school is part of CHED (commission on higher education) even if quarantine end we still have to finish online classes,0.25,Positive

"We're actually doing the exact same thing here in California, but it differs depending on the professor. I took a sociology class over the summer, which i had finished a few weeks ago, and all she did was release audio lectures, post slides from previous years, made us read an online textbook, and assign group work. We had tests almost every week.",-0.023333333333333334,Negative

"First off I don't think it's a good thing to state ""in the Philippines"", you haven't experienced studying in each and every school in the Ph for you to say that. Plus, it will give a poor impression to ""non-Ph"" people. I'm currently in the Ph and studying here too via online classes. It's totally a fine experience for me, no problem on most times.",0.3238095238095238,Positive

"*^(""the school expects the students to learn what is taught by the teachers by themselves (my current situation we are currently learning chemistry and enthalpy and one of the home-works expects student to have the background knowledge for this, I don‚Äôt, due to difference in curriculum"")*

*^(""...classes is basically the teacher reading what‚Äôs on the slide. Its absolutely annoying and mind numbing."")*

Interested to know which school you are in since this sounds like many PH universities üêØ doing their usual face-to-face classes, even before the Rona came around. :)))",0.009374999999999994,Positive
"The first weeks in my private school online are great but I went downhill and fucked, it gets worse in the next term. I hate how the school teachers brag about my classmates by their ""good examples"" that make me even more worthless than my own soul. Seems like every school doesn't give a damn about me and the others who left fucked inside. I hope I can end my misery by just sleeping until the pandemic ends.",-0.02692307692307693,Negative
