"It’s a struggle for a lot. If things get bad 1 withdrawal for the semester (or class drops) will not kill your career. Especially during a situation like a pandemic. 

Keep your head up. You are not alone and if you need to withdraw for this semester- you have a good case for any future job, grad school, even med school when backing your decision.

I don’t know many who really signed up to experience Wisconsin online. But I hate it. I hated it last semester. Hate it now. I’m a senior and I’m in a couple of freshman classes and a load of extremely hard classes. I work 730am- 11pm (learning disability) in online coursework 7 days a week. I see only my parents even though I have a vibrant social life that was stifled. I am struggling and every other day I get really down.

In summary, it sucks for me really bad and I’ve seen many feel the same. I wish it wasn’t like this, especially for freshmen, but you will make it through whatever your decision. Talk to an advisor and weigh your options.

And whether or not you hang in there or not, no one should look down on you.",-0.12853535353535347,Negative
"Great advice from the badger above!!!

I would also like to add (current undergrad hating online courses) it might be worth considering a reduced course load opposed to completely dropping out. I started out the term as a full time student, but after a week or so of being fed up with online courses, I reduced my credits + got involved in other ways.

 In my opinion, these times are unprecedented, I dont blame UW for the online education I've been receiving. I'm just a hands on learner that feels like I would benefit greatly from in person instruction. By reducing my credit hours+ bill this year, I plan to put my money toward in person instruction at a later semester.

Additionally, dont worry too much about the future implications on changing your enrollment right now. Covid has effected everyone and any reasonable person would understand your decision to pause your schooling. Just try and stay active in the community regardless! 

Good luck !",0.26369047619047625,Positive
"Online classes are insanely taxing. What the hell is going on?? In Fall 2019, I swear to God. I took 13 credits, worked from 1 to 5 PM (5 days a week). And had time to go to the gym 4 days a week. My GPA was 3.85 /4.
Now im taking 15 credits remotely from my home country, and the pressure is insane. Never had a single day off.",-0.5428571428571429,Negative
"completely agree that online is a lot more work and way harder (especially for those of us who have to use honorlock, maybe not so much if you have open book/open note exams). Just praying for that vaccine so we can get can get back to 'normal' college.",0.10625,Positive
"I think it is a bit early to think about dropping out. First, recognize that you are not alone, many people struggle their freshman year and many people are struggling with this new online learning. Then consider that the classes you are taking are not the correct fit for you. There are many many different paths to take to reach a career that makes you happy and it might be helpful to delay taking difficult major focused classes and take gen eds and electives instead.

Get through the semester and reconsider.",0.2707386363636364,Positive
"also a freshman and I know the struggle! I would advise not dropping out but I know we might be in very different circumstances in terms of workloads 

here's a link to a Tumblr post of online class advice that's helped me a bunch! one thing that they don't mention is studying with a classmate (if ur on campus), something that helped me pass a midterm was studying for like two hours with a kid in my class, it was my first time meeting him but we hit it off and both ended up doing well :)

"Yeah I feel your pain. Just had my first set of midterms last week and got the results back. They did not go as I thought they would, which was really difficult for me to handle because I thought that I was prepared and had studied enough. It's been really hard to concentrate/stay focused with all of this online learning too and most (well mine anyways) of the professors aren't being generous with curves/grades. Moreover, if you're doing really bad in a class and think you won't be able to recover your grade I would just drop out. It comes down to what you think will look worse; a D or F or a dropped.",-0.07247474747474747,Negative
"It looks like the deadline to drop is Nov 20 without dean permission, and it shows up as DR on your transcript if that helps. Just know that you’re out for full tuition at this point, however. Definitely talk to your advisor about dropping to make sure it doesn’t cause any issues.

"We are only in October and there is still time for recovery for your grades, and since you could not get tuition back that is what I would recommend.

Online classes are a completely new way of learning we were all just thrown into; be easier on yourself! It takes time and practice to make a routine and get the hang of it, which I know is super hard, but it is truly the only way through. Here is my advice:

* Try to build a weekly routine that surrounds your schedule / due dates. Example, if you have homework due on Friday for a class every week, make a routine to do the homework Thursday afternoon or Friday morning every week. Then, do that for the rest of your assignments. It will build a routine and make it a little easier to do. 
* Go to the non-mandatory lectures, discussions, and office hours if you aren't understanding material; but if you are make sure to give yourself a break!! Taking brain-breaks from the computer is super important, I like to study in the morning, take a break in the afternoon for a walk / food, and then finish up in the evening for a couple hours. 
* When you listen to lectures, make sure you understand what is being said and try to be in an atmosphere where you can focus. If you don't understand, go back and listen again, google it, try youtube (especially for math or science)! 
* Make the little assignments count! If you are getting 95% or higher on all the little assignments, that will leave more lee-way for exams. 
* Get organized! Have your big assignments (Exam / Paper / Final Projects) on a big calendar to plan other life events around. On Sundays, list all your assignments due that week and make a schedule for when you WILL do those assignments (refer to bullet-point 1). 

You've got this!",0.08171164772727273,Positive
"If dropping one course would free up more time (either for other courses, or just mental health breaks in-between studying) then honestly don't feel stressed about doing so.  I've dropped courses in the past so I could focus on the ones I was doing well in, and that wasn't even during a global pandemic! Don't be so hard on yourself right now, it's okay to be struggling, and from the posts on this sub and conversations with people in general, we all are struggling to have pre-pandemic levels of productivity. Best of luck!",0.21408730158730158,Positive
"Given your tuition is gone and no way to get that back, I would try to hang in there. Maybe you can put all your effort into a couple of your classes so that at least you get those credits and then worry about re-taking the others another semester when we aren't online. Then I would talk with your advisor about enrolling in community college for spring--just make sure you can still come back to Wisco. This online world sucks and your experience here will be completely different once we get back to normal instruction. Good luck!",0.10277777777777779,Positive
