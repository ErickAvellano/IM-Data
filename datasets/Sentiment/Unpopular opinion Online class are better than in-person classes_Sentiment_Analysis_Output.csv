"I read that almost all Top Rated universities do ... for example Harvard has a tool even for students which even helps them personalise themselves too. They use something called Panopto other highly rated universities use it too ... not even talking about lectures shared internally. A lot of Harvard lectures are even posted on YouTube not just internally shared. I can give a lot more examples too just wanted to stay consistent.

Concordia is in the Dark Ages because not even their serves are up to par with what a university should have.

Edited: Of course all before the Pandemic.

There are countless other companies out there. I can give you a big list of universities too but it will be pointless.

Just wondering before you state a fact do you actually do research or a simple google search? The way you state it I would have believed it if I didn't already know they do and have been doing so for a while now.

I mean you are right in a sense if we are talking about all universities in the world .. considering universities which offer bachelors without any credibility and ones in places with no means of technology like here.

Another cool thing I don't know if Concordia does. Many universities like Harvard also do lectures out in the open. Like a park .. etc",0.08332706766917294,Positive
"Absolutely. In my case: graduated summer '20. It always depends on your major, however, I would still prefer an in-person option so that I can have a look at the course outline on day 1 :) And if there is no 100% final then I would just DNE the class.. Concordia is a party school after all.",0.190625,Positive
"As a commuter (\~1 hr 15) there are definitely positives. I have more time because I spend 0 time on bus and metro.

But it's a bit mind-numbingly boring to spend all day in front of a computer. I miss interacting with classmates face-to-face. Also, this is my first year and I'm in engineering and I imagine I'm missing out on a lot of actual hands-on experience. Oh well.",-0.075,Negative

"I don’t know what you study but for Business, classes are crucial because it’s not just about learning materials but also networking, and team building.

Plus you meet new people and sometimes make some new friends, it’s in my opinion is a crucial part of University because if you are just planning on learning stuffs and writing exams, just get a Udemy subscription.

All those classes, socialization, presentations prepared me for my workplace more than any of my courses by itself.

"This way of learning can be very efficient, but it requires one to be organised and keep up with the work while one can easily start doing something else and not study, since a distraction is just a click away. On the other hand, when someone heads towards campus, they don't have much to get distracted by and just go do the stuff they have to do in class (concentrate on schoolwork).

In other words, you pay for the convenience of being able to study from home by having to get organised and disciplined enough to not be distracted by what is just a click away.

Basically:

Class at Home -&gt; Can be very good but you need to get organised and disciplined to get the advantages it has over the at school classes.

Class at school -&gt; Usually good for the majority (people that are not super strict when it comes to organization), since there are not a lot of things to distract you while in the 'study environment.'",0.2526666666666667,Positive

"Even without in-person classes, it doesn't change the fact that studying and working full time is not possible unless you have exceptionally good time management skills, and the course difficulty level remains the same in terms of assignments and exams.

"I agree with your unpopular opinion. Its saved me hundreds on having to buy a opus and wasting 5 hours a day in commuting. I love being able to watch lectures online whenever I want and being able to pause it without interrupting the entire class. Overall it made school way more comfortable for me as if I'm having a bad day or something I can skip this lecture and I can watch it later without fear of missing out on a physical class. 

Also maybe I'm the exception but my professors have gotten back to my questions relatively pretty fast so that hasn't been an issue for me, most have even offered extra help that normally wouldn't be there to help students.",0.15294117647058825,Positive
"Well more time to exercise with all sport facilities closed, not very useful :x",0.09487179487179488,Positive
"Well it's not the only inaccurate point:

1) Yes x2 helps, but I mean even before covid I was not relying on my profs to learn something, I would watch that indian dude on youtube with his shitty mic and put the video on x2 so this point is not a revolution.  
2) You could do that before (Google being your 24/7 or stackoverflow for the cs/soen people)  
3) You do save transport time to get to the office since it's remote but doesn't give more opportunies to balance between internship and study  
4) i would say more after 1 week but if there are 20 people that still find the lecture worth to attend, I mean they are hurting nobody (without the covid situation ofc)  
5) No, there is no reason for that unless you used to have in-person classes until 11 PM   
6) Already answered that point  
7) Well some profs just don't give a fuck since it's online. I've contacted many profs about issues I had and since you don't ask them in person (aka harass them at their office) they don't give a fuck and don't even answer your mails. I have a prof basically all what he does is prerecord lectures, split the grade weight into 4 assignments and yell at students during his 2 hours of availabilities. Only god knows what he does during this semester.

in my case i don't really mind if we keep online lectures but at least reopen the buildings, i wanna take my usual seat at 7th floor HB and look at the sunset during hours",-0.0053571428571428615,Negative
"Here are the pros and cons of e-classes in my case (I’m an engineering student):

Pros:
- recorded lectures -&gt; ability to relisten at your pace
- I take digital notes so it’s convenient for me to just screenshot the lecture screen and ctrl V to my notes
- no commute - saves time and money
- I can eat a full course meal while listening to the lecture
- if I feel tired, I can just quit the lecture, go take a nap and watch the recording when my mind is back at 100% -&gt; better information retaining

Cons:
- eclass = e-exams, I have a love hate relationship with them. People cheat so profs curve the grade down to hell and then the people who didnt cheat suffer. Some profs make the exams insanely hard to avoid cheating. And don’t get me started on proctored exams
- certain classes require students to be in person practice - labs, etc. especially in engineering. We need to work with hardware. 
- human interactions - i miss seeing friends. Uni is the time to make friends and make connections for our future career as well. I have barely made any new friends since covid started.

In brief, I would be perfectly happy if schools are a mix of: online lectures + in person labs + in person tutorials + in person exams",0.053142772260419316,Positive
"What you say is theoretically true but in reality you end up sitting in front of computer for 3-4 hours a day of lectures not mentionng the time  to do homework so you end up not having time to exercice or do other things, not mentioning the labs that are the most important thing in engineering that are useless now online.more sleeping time is the only thing happening.",0.10416666666666667,Positive
"I actually agree with the exercise that was mentioned. With classes online, I've actually had time to go out and run. When classes are in person, I can't run in between classes cuz I wouldn't have time to go home, shower and change before attending my next class. Classes online allow you to go out in between classes and even skip class and watch the recording later in the day after your workout. People might also eat healthier as they can cook at home instead of having to eat at the many restaurants downtown because you didnt have time to make a lunch before leaving in the morning",0.1,Positive
"If your prof makes an effort to teach well, it’s a positive experience regardless of the platform of delivery.

"YES! I can't focus in lectures because they are too slow paced, but with recorded lectures, I can actually pay attention to them because I watch them all in 2x?

"I feel like this is true for some classes but not all. I’m taking some history courses and wow online is a godsend. I find this way better than in person lectures and have been getting more out of it, especially with profs who adapted their courses to run online well. But I’m in Studio Art, and the classes have really suffered. Seeing your classmates work and critiques have not gone well and it’s much harder to make actual progress in technical aspects. We can’t do so much and it’s a nightmare.",0.175,Positive
Agree online recordings are great! They should continue to record lectures for 2022 and let students choose to come to class or just watch!,1.0,Positive
Yes. Giving us the choice would be nice from their part as people who are still scared of covid can stay at home while also still being able to attend their lectures. Maybe have in-person sections and online sections like how ECON has for macro and microeconomics,0.55,Positive
entirety of the OP is negated if in-person classes are recorded for reference,0.0,Neutral
Profs won't record their in person lectures as that would require more work from them as they would have to set up a camera or recording tool and upload the file. Some profs already have  a problem recording their remote course and uploading their slides. So asking them to record their in person lectures would be even worst,-0.19999999999999998,Negative
"University has always been about you teaching yourself the material, the professor, textbook, and readings is just your guide.
