"For me personally, in my whole life,i never went to any type of tuitions and coachings and scored decent (82% in 12th) since i was not the studious type and played cricket at district level and almost state level till 5 months ago, studied just to pass, but suddenly had a bad toe and back injury, whole cricketing career ruined (for now atleast) decided i will start taking academics seriously, and here i am in a drop year lol, but i think my prep is going decently well (144/300) in previous full syllabus mock test so my opinion would be that online is better if you have confidence that you can sit for hours without getting distracted which i think i have. But then again, i never went to offline so my opinion might be biased",0.09861111111111114,Positive

" i literally just watched one shots for all chapters except electrostatics and magnetism , watched full alakh sir videos for these 2 chapters and for all other chapters i just watched one shots on yt and did a lot of pyq's, my advise is that buy the arihant board pyq book. i just studied physics in last 1-2 months and got 81/100 just by doing this, which isnt a lot, but given the time i gave to physics, i think it was an expected result . Also, if you want really good physics conceptual lectures then go for ABJ sir free yt lectures, they are above boards level but 100% better than any other content on youtube for physics concepts in my opinion.",0.17777777777777778,Positive
 Too much independence like your excessible with resources with lectures like today's nlm lecture but I have to also my friend is calling me to play some games okay let's leave I can do this lecture whenever I can want and then it becomes backlog and  you fall into depression and this process remains for a long time but to be honest if 25tard is seeing this comment  then dude you are really blessed with this that you have discovered this subreddit you can get guide from your senior and whenever you feel like doubt if you don't even have a like what you say will to ask the doubt or post then just go on search option and type your doubt a lot of people has already posted about that out and you would get the solution of  your doubt without posting,0.29,Positive

"downvote me how much ever u want but at one point y'all are gonna realize this

tbh i find online lectures and these yt videos  a sheer waste of time .

like many ppl are completely dependent on these things

&amp;#x200B;

see in offline coaching classes u have a restriction , in a 2 hour class u can max to max talk to your friend but can't do random bullshit and you have to listen to the teacher either way so thts the best thing out thr   
in online u have complete freedom, you search differential equation lectures and 10 youtubers you will find who have uploaded videos , you will end up being confused and end up not studying thinking this teacher teaches better and stuff

&amp;#x200B;

ultimate solution to this is rather focus on reading books , yes except for organic and inorganic chem , atleast i do this 

i rather read the chapters  theory from cengage  , wherever i get stuck i take help of youtube lectures and THIS IS HOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO STUDY !!!

&amp;#x200B;

all these lectures were supposed to aid you in learning , and not become completely dependent on them like sab kuch yeh hi kare , arey bhai khud se bhi kuch kaam karo proofs derive kro , i know with the time remaining these things seem impossible but its possible if you're not involved in 10 things and only focus on studying from the book

&amp;#x200B;

so in short , u can use lectures but i would recommend reading theory from books , incase u don't understand theory from books in 1st reading 

&amp;#x200B;

u can watch unacademy / pw manzil batch one shot lectures of tht chapter , no need to watch full one shot maybe 4 hours ka hei toh watch 2 hours make notes 

&amp;#x200B;

and then u can read that much theory from the book like cengage and solve questions , slowly you will start understanding things from the book and also this will improve reading and problem solving skills 

hope it helps ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30331)",0.04541666666666668,Positive
"Maybe cuz you are supposed to do practice after lecture that's why watching lecture is bad if you don't solve anything. Your points are good but not correct. Lecture before solving any module is good and helps to build concept. 

You are using books. Books have many question + examples + exercise. So, it is same as a full course (Lecture + module) except a teacher to teach.

Those, who are focusing on 10 lecture and 10 teachers are as same as having many books. Both goes nowhere.

If you got discipline and will to study. Doesn't matter book or lecture. You will excel. For me, lecture are good for starting a chapter. If you want to end a chapter after doing a module (if you have any time left) then go for a book.

So technically that's not a problem with online learning because the same can happen while using books. Simple, books are only for studying while devices can be associated with fun and learning so using device while lecturing makes the process harder. Associating phone/laptop for studying purpose only will be same as using a book although.",0.15526315789473683,Positive
"hmm yeah tru- 

but many ppl are too distracted on laptop / mobile and watch lectures on tht

"i was a little skeptical of your answer at first but you reasoned it out pretty well, especially you suggesting books cuz i too read maths theory and qns from cengage and its 10x more productive and also builds that non-spoon-feeding way of learning which helps out in retention",0.052083333333333336,Positive
